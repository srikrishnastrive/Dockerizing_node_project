Dockerization of Node.js Module
This repository contains a Node.js module that has been Dockerized to run in a Docker container. This README provides instructions on how to set up the Docker image and run the Node.js module inside a container.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Docker
Node.js
Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/node-module.git
cd node-module
2. Build Docker Image
Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t node-module-image .
3. Run Docker Container
Run a Docker container using the built image:

bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name node-module-container node-module-image
This command maps port 8080 inside the Docker container to port 8080 on your host machine. Replace 8080 with the port your Node.js application is listening on, if it's different.

4. Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8080
You should see the application running inside the Docker container.

Additional Commands
Stop Container
To stop the running Docker container, use:

bash
Copy code
docker stop node-module-container
Remove Container
To remove the stopped Docker container, use:

bash
Copy code
docker rm node-module-container
Remove Image
To remove the Docker image, use:

bash
Copy code
docker rmi node-module-image
